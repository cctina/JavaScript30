You can use these sounds however you like! You do not have to give me any mentions in using them. (Its always appreciated though) Some of you have shared links to your soundcloud accounts where you have showcased yourself using my sounds. This is AWESOME! 
I'd love for you guys to head on over to see my youtube channel. I hardly upload videos, So if u subscribed. U will not get spam saying ''bla bla has uploaded a new video'' every 2 days. BUT, You will get free tutorials, Free samples, Free Soundsets, And FREE, EXCLUSIVE content available only to my subscribers. My channel was on private up until just over 1 week ago. And so far I have had a nice amount of views, But not nearly as much as I would of had if my videos weren't on private. So, If you subscribe, I take requests, And offer to reply to them with video responses. So, Please don't be a stranger. I would love to meet more of you guys, Hit me up with a private message !

> About me: I make ALL my content from the ground up, 
I sample from analog drum machines, I never use softsynths in my sample material. I just prefer to offer the best samples possible. So that you have a unique collection. ( Without the unique price tag! )
I wanted to offer something that outshines the commercial packs standard. I do release sample packs commercially, But, I chose to also release free ones. 
I basically wanted to help fight audio piracy. So, I came on here, And uploaded some of my own sounds which I myself use. Which has literally been years in the making! & you guys responded with gratitude! 
So, Thank you! I shall continue to bring you nothing but the best sounds, 
If you use my samples in a tutorial, PLEASE just give me a super quick mention and feel free to share the link to my sounds with your friends! 
;-)
